# Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a few simple data science examples I've worked on in the past. These are not meant to reflect the full extent of my capabilities but rather to demonstrate fundamental workflows in data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Projects Included

- `us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and basic modeling on a dataset of U.S. insurance charges.
- `hangman_challenge`: A basic logic-based implementation to demonstrate string manipulation and control flow.

> **Note:** These projects are intentionally simple. I am capable of building and deploying much more complex models—from advanced machine learning pipelines to production-ready data applications. I can deliver what’s needed, no matter the level of complexity.

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

If you'd like to see examples of more advanced work or have a specific project in mind, feel free to reach out.
