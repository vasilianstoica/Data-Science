# Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a few simple example projects meant to showcase core data science workflows. While the examples here are intentionally basic, they reflect foundational techniques I’ve used as part of more advanced work.

I have hands-on experience with deep learning, particularly with **bi-directional LSTM models**, which are incorporated in several of my projects—including those that may appear simplistic at first glance, such as the Hangman challenge. I am comfortable working with both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, and I understand how to build, tune, and deploy deep learning pipelines when required.

> **Note:** These projects are intentionally simple. I am capable of building and deploying much more complex models—from advanced machine learning pipelines to production-ready data applications. I can deliver what’s needed, no matter the level of complexity.
