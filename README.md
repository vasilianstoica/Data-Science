# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository brings together a selection of technical projects focused on machine learning, statistical modeling, and deep learning applications. Each notebook reflects work on solving structured problems with real-world dataâ€”across healthcare, public policy, environmental science, and finance.

## Projects Included
- **Regression Modeling**: [Medical Insurance Cost Prediction]([Predicting Medical Insurance Costs](Data-Science/1_Predicting_Medical_Insurance_Costs_with_Regression_Modeling/Predicting_Medical_Insurance_Costs_with_Regression_Modeling.ipynb)
)  
  Using linear models and ensemble methods to predict insurance charges from demographic and health features.

- **Correlation Modeling**: [Socioeconomic Indicators & Life Expectancy](Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Correlation_Modeling_on_Socioeconomic_Indicators.ipynb)  
  Investigating the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across countries over time.

- **Statistical Inference & Biodiversity**: [Species Status in U.S. National Parks](Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Statistical_Inference_&_Clustering_of_National_Park_Biodiversity.ipynb)  
  Testing whether endangered status is linked to species category using Chi-squared tests.

- **Wrapper-Based Feature Selection**: [Obesity Classification](Feature_Selection_for_Obesity_Prediction_Comparing_Wrapper_Methods.ipynb)  
  Comparing Recursive Feature Elimination, Sequential Forward, and Backward Selection on health behavior data.

- **Time Series Forecasting**: [Solana Price Prediction & Strategy Backtest](Time_Series_Forecasting_and_Trading_Signal_Generation_with_Bidirectional_LSTM_on_Solana.ipynb)  
  A prototype for price forecasting and long-only trading signal generation using LSTMs.

- **Applied Deep Learning**: [Neural Hangman Solver (Trexquant Challenge)](Neural_Hangman_Solver_with_Attention_Trexquant_Challenge.ipynb)  
  A custom PyTorch attention model for real-time character guessing in a language puzzle game.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Supervised learning (regression, classification)
  - Deep learning (LSTM, attention mechanisms)
  - Feature selection
  - Time series modeling
  - Statistical inference
  - Model evaluation & visualization

## Notes
All projects are self-contained and developed as standalone notebooks. The goal is to demonstrate technical understanding, clean code, and structured analysis. While some projects are more exploratory and others more performance-driven, all are built with reproducibility and clarity in mind.
